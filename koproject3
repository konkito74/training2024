 Add a 6 GB disk to your system.
1-Create a logical volume with the name “Lo” by using 50PE’s from the volume group “Vo”. Consider the PE size as “6MB”. Mount it on /data with XFS file system.

2-Create a new logical volume with the name “Database” by using 500MB from the volume group “Datastore”. Mount it on /vfatdatabse with vfat filesystem.

3-Extend the swap space by 500MB using partition.

4-Resize “Lo” logical volume so that it becomes 600MB. Any size in between 570MB to 630MB is fine.

5- deploy the server to your home network. Name Server: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. hostname: linuxserver.example.com.

6-Configure chronyd service and sync server to the following NTP Server us.server.ntp.org
